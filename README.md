# Springer Nature Front End Candidate Assignment (React + TypeScript + SCSS + Vite)

To get started:

- Run command 'npm install'
- Run command 'npm run dev'

Notes:
Error states are handled by native browser warnings via semantic html and adding 'required' and 'pattern' attributes to input elements. I could change this to be handled by my React state if necessary.
